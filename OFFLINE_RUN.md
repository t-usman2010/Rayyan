# Run the Birthday Surprise Locally

This project archive contains the React source code and every required local media file. The images, logo, favicon, and custom music track are all stored in `client/public/media/`, so they do not depend on hosted asset URLs.

## Quick start

Install a current Node.js release, then open a terminal inside the extracted project folder and run:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open the local address printed by the terminal, normally `http://localhost:3000`.

## What is bundled

| Item | Local location |
| --- | --- |
| Hero birthday artwork | `client/public/media/petal-postcard-hero.jpg` |
| Birthday cake artwork | `client/public/media/pink-birthday-cake.jpg` |
| Bow-heart logo and favicon | `client/public/media/petal-bow-heart-logo.png` |
| Background music | `client/public/media/` |

## Production build

To create a production build on your machine, run:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`. The multi-page birthday routes, music player, confetti gift reveal, and all media assets remain local to the extracted project.
